0) Download the PhotoOrganizer.exe
1) RUN as Administrator
2) Select Origin folder (it must not have sub folders otherwise it will crash)
3) Select "copy" or "move"
4) Press Organize
5) If you want to use the same folder where the files are in, select the same folder in both options and select "Move"

** TESTED ONLY IN WINDOWS IDK IF IT WORKS IN MAC

How it works? 
1) First checks the file name, if the date is in the title it will extract it and use it for organize the file
2) If the title does not have the date the script will check metadata of the file
